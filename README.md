FastNeRF Project
Overview
FastNeRF is a neural radiance field (NeRF) implementation optimized for speed and efficiency. It leverages PyTorch for high-performance GPU acceleration. This project aims to provide a fast, scalable solution for 3D scene rendering using deep learning.

Features
Positional encoding layer for high-dimensional input data.
Separate networks for positional and directional components.
Efficient data loading for training on large datasets.
Customizable network architecture to adapt to various dataset sizes.
Installation
To get started with FastNeRF, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_github/fastenerf.git
cd fastenerf
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preparing Your Data
Ensure your data is in the expected format. This project uses .npz files containing images, poses, and focal lengths.

python
Copy code
from dataset import load_data

images, poses, focal = load_data('path/to/your/dataset.npz')
Training
To train the model, use the following command. Adjust the parameters based on your dataset and hardware configuration.

python
Copy code
from train import train_model

train_model(data_path='path/to/your/dataset.npz', epochs=10, batch_size=4)
Evaluation
Evaluate the model by generating images from the trained NeRF model.

python
Copy code
from evaluate import generate_images

generate_images(model_path='path/to/your/model.pth', data_path='path/to/your/dataset.npz')
Results
Showcase the results of your FastNeRF model with before and after images, performance metrics, or any other relevant outcomes.
